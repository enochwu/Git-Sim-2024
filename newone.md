For some reason I can't get Git to add/stage the edited readme.md 

So Here's some not so great pseudocode

Start
LOOP
Limit loop to 25 scans
    Check If 25 scans is reached 
        Then print "100 products counted, case is full."
        END LOOP Do not allow scan 
        Else follow below
  Every time the device scans the product package, have it add 2 to the previous number
    Print even numbers only, range starts at 2, ends at 50.
END L00P


Allow for reset of device.

End
